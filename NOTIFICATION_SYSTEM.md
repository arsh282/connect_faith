# Notification System Implementation

This document outlines the notification system added to the Church App, which includes real-time notifications for events.

## Features

### For Members:
- **Notification Bell**: Replaces the logout button in the top-right corner of the member panel
- **Badge Counter**: Shows the number of unread notifications
- **Notification Panel**: Opens on bell click to show all notifications
- **Event Notifications**: Receive notifications when an admin creates a new event
- **Reminder Notifications**: Receive reminders one day before an event
- **Mark as Read**: Option to mark individual or all notifications as read
- **Logout Option**: Available within the notification panel

### For Admins:
- **Event Creation**: Creates notifications automatically when a new event is added
- **Admin Control**: Admin users still have the regular logout button

## Technical Implementation

### Components:
1. **NotificationBell.js**: The UI component that displays the bell icon with badge counter
2. **NotificationsContext.js**: Context provider for managing notifications state
3. **eventNotificationService.js**: Service for handling event notification logic

### Data Flow:
1. Admin creates an event
2. Event notification is generated and stored for each member
3. Bell icon updates with unread count
4. Members can view and manage their notifications

### Storage:
- Notifications are stored per-user in AsyncStorage
- Event check timestamps are stored to prevent duplicate notifications

## Usage

### For Developers:
```javascript
// Add a notification
import { useNotifications } from '../context/NotificationsContext';

const { addNotification } = useNotifications();

// Add a simple notification
addNotification({
  title: 'Your notification title',
  message: 'Notification message'
});

// Add an event notification
addEventNotification(eventObject, false); // false = new event, true = reminder
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**: Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging or similar service for push notifications
2. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to select which notifications they want to receive
3. **Rich Content**: Support for images and action buttons within notifications
4. **Categorized Notifications**: Filter notifications by type (events, announcements, etc.)
5. **Custom Notification Sounds**: Different sounds for different notification types
