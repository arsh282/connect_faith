3. **Ensure the images are in PNG format** for best quality
4. **The app will automatically use these images** once they're placed here

## Alternative: Use Your Own Image Names

If you prefer to use different filenames, you can:
1. Rename your images to match the filenames above, OR
2. Update the `require()` statements in the login screen code to match your image names

## Next Steps

Once you add these images:
1. The login screen will automatically display your church building as the background
2. Your CONNECTFAITH logo will appear in the white circle
3. The design will be fully branded with your actual images
4. We can then move on to styling other screens with your images
